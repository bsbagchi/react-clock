# Clock

A React-based analog clock that calculates angles for clock hands using AssemblyScript for performance. This project demonstrates the integration of WebAssembly with a React front-end.

## Features

- Real-time clock displaying hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Efficient angle calculations performed in AssemblyScript.
- Responsive design with modern JavaScript and TypeScript.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **AssemblyScript**: TypeScript-like syntax for WebAssembly, providing fast performance for computations.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience.
- **CSS**: For styling the clock.
